# Mini-Greenhouse
Arduino miniature greenhouse monitoring and watering project.

Equipment List:
1. Arduino (Current in use: Leonardo)
2. Soil Moisture Sensor (Current in use: Jaycar XC4604)
3. RTC Module (in use: Jaycar XC4450)
4. 5V Relay Module (in use: Jaycar XC4419)
5. Temperature and Humidity Sensor (in use: DHT11 Jaycar XC4520)
6. 12V Solenoid Water Valve (TBC)
  or 12V Pump to be operated from (4.) relay module.
7. Irrigation equipment (6mm tubing, connections, fine mist spray nozzles)

Prototyping equipment used:
1. Breadboard
2. Breadboard power supply
3. Jumper cables (various)

Future Development:
1. Remote display (using LoRa or xBee)
2. Solar operation of greenhouse sensor & watering system
